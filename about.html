		<h1>About Me</h1>
			<img id="scottb" src="img/ScottB.jpg" alt="me" title="Scott Buehrer" />

		<p>My name is Scott Buehrer and I am an IT Technician for the City of Bryan. I am a techie professionally and by nature. When I am not working on something nerdy I like to go fishing, preferably from a boat.
			I am not a very good fisherman by any means but I do enjoy it. Some of my favorite places to fish and type of fish are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Turkey Foot Creek - Crappie</li>
		<li>Auglaize River - Crappie</li>
		<li>Devils Lake - Blue Gill</li>
		<li>Cold Water Lake - Bluegill and Bass</li>
		<li>Jacksonville Beach - too many to list</li>
	</ul>
		<p>I also spent a couple years restoring a '78 Monte Carlo that was from my childhood, probably one of my greatest achievements, besides my family.</p>
