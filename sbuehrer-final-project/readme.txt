I added a Jquery image gallery. It worked well until i coppied th efolder to location, it still works but is a little flaky. I can add more pictures in teh future since there are only enough to show that it works. the nav bar has something to be desired and i will continue to practice with it but for some reasone i was having problems with the css. It still turned out better than i thought using all my own code except for some JS and Jquery.
